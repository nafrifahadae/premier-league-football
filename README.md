# ⚽ Premier League Evolution Analysis (2006/07 vs 2023/24)

*Exploring how the world’s most-watched league has evolved through data.*

## Overview

This project investigates how the English Premier League has evolved over 17 years, focusing on disciplinary trends, offensive output, and stylistic shifts in football. Using Excel, data from the 2006/07 and 2023/24 seasons was compiled and analysed to understand the broader transformation of the modern game.

The analysis aims to visualise key differences in tackles, fouls, yellow/red cards, as well as offensive stats such as touches, passes, shots, and goals — offering insights into how football has become more possession-based, controlled, and tactical.

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes all clubs from the 2006/07 and 2023/24 seasons (acknowledging that some clubs appear in only one season). Key columns include:

- **Team**
- **Tackles**, **Fouls**, **Yellow Cards**, **Red Cards**
- **Touches**, **Passes**, **Shots**, **Goals**
- **Season (2006/07 or 2023/24)**

The data was structured for comparison across seasons and club levels.

## 📊 Key Insights

### 🟥 Discipline Trends
- **Fewer tackles and fouls** in 2023/24 compared to 2006/07.
- **Yellow cards** are marginally up, while **red cards** are slightly down.
- Suggests greater protection for players and stricter enforcement of rules.

### 🎯 Offensive Output
- Modern teams average **more touches and passes**, reflecting a **possession-heavy** approach.
- **Shot and goal numbers** have also increased — but more modestly.
- Offensive play is now more calculated and fluid, reducing reckless physicality.

### ⚖️ Playing Style Evolution
- The modern Premier League is:
  - **Less combative**, due to VAR, stricter refereeing, and improved pitch quality.
  - **More technical**, with a focus on buildup and control.
  - **Faster decision-making**, supported by tactical coaching and fitness.

## 📌 Visualisation Goals (Power BI-ready)

You can enhance the project by importing this dataset into **Power BI**, where visualisations can include:
- Season-by-season comparison bar charts
- Team-by-team breakdowns of discipline and offensive stats
- Radar charts showing average team profiles
- Callout cards for key metrics (e.g. average goals per team per season)

This makes the data **accessible to football fans and non-fans alike**, offering a visual narrative of the game’s transformation.

## 📚 Key Learning Outcomes

- Translate raw football statistics into **story-driven insights**
- Compare multi-season datasets and extract meaningful differences
- Prepare and structure Excel data for BI tools like Power BI
- Develop hypotheses (e.g. impact of VAR, coaching, fitness) supported by data

## 💡 Discussion Points

- Has refereeing become stricter or more lenient?
- Do higher passing numbers correlate with fewer cards?
- What does the increase in touches and passes say about modern tactics?

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Build a dynamic Power BI dashboard for presentation
- Add a short write-up/synopsis within the dashboard explaining the era-based changes
- Combine this analysis with player-level stats for deeper insights
